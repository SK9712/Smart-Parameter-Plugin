# Smart Parameter Plugin

## Introduction

Smart Parameter is a Jenkins plugin that enables smart, conditional parameters in your build forms. 
Smart-Parameter dynamically shows or hides input fields based on values of other parameters, creating cleaner, 
more intuitive build forms that adapt to user selections.

## Getting started

```
mvn hpi:run -Dport=5000

mvn clean package
```
